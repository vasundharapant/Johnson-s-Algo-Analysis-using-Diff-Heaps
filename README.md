# Johnson-s-Algo-Analysis-using-Diff-Heaps
This project contains the analysis of Johnson's Algorithm's performance using different heaps(Array, Binary, Binomial, Fibonacci) to perform the Dijkstra part of the Johnson's Algorithm. The time complexity using various heaps was calculated and compared to draw conclusions as to which heap works best.
